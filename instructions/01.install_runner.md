I made a (terrible) video about installing a runner on SmartOS, password is:

```
ntrace!!

Anyway, here are the steps in text:

# Installing a Runner

For installing a runner is a series of manual steps.

## 1. A SmartOS VM

A runner is a Node.js process that runs on a machine that's running SmartoOS (for the time being).

To install a runner you must have a SmartOS VM. Personally, I use VMWare Fusion and the latest SmartOS image for it. (I know, I'm too lazy to use VirtualBox, but all kinds of people have reported problems running SmartOS on it, so I'm sticking with VMWare Fusion for development)

Go through the SmartOS installation steps.

Reboot.

SSH to it.

## 2. Configure Image Server

nTrace has it's own image server. Add it to the global zone using this command:

```bash
$ imgadm sources -a http://images.ntrace.io
```

## 3. Install the latest nTrace runner image

List all available nTrace images:

```bash
$ imgadm avail | grep ntrace
```

This should output an a list of images. Select the latest ntrace-smartos-riunner one nd copy the UUID and install it:

```bash
$ imgadm import <UUID>
```

## 4. Create the Runner VM

Download the latest VM manifest template from [here](https://github.com/ntrace/provisioner/blob/master/templates/default.json) into the global zone named `manifest-json` (anywhere in the file system).

Edit it, changing the `image_uuid` field to the runner image you just imported. Also, set

Create the VM using the command:

```bash
$ vmadm create < manifest.json
```

After this command successfully executed, you should see the new VM here:

```bash
$ vmadm list
```

## 5. Add Runner SSH Key to your dev machine

Now you need to allow runner to connect to the dispatcher process that will be running on your local machine. For that to happen you need to add the runner ssh key to your local machine.

First, from the globak zone zlogin into the runner VM:

```bash
$ zlogin <runner vm uuid>
```

### 5.1. Configure the dispatcher host name in SSH config

Once in there, edit the runner ssh config file under `~/.ssh/config`.

Look for the `ntrace-dispatcher` entry and change the hostname value to the value of your dev machine, should be an IP address that is reachable from within the runner VM.

### 5.2. Add the runner public key to your dev machine

In the runner VM do:

```bash
$ cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy the public key to your clipboard and add it to your machine `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

### 5.3 enable SSH server in your dev machine

If you don't already have an SSH server running in your dev machine, install / enable it.

### Test it

Test the configuration by ssh'ing from your runner VM into your dev machine:

```bash
$ ssh ntrace-dispatcher
```


## 6. Configure the nTrace runner servive

In the runner VM:

### 6.1. Disable the runner service

First, disable the nTrace runner service:

```bash
$ svcadm disable ntrace-runner
```

### 6.2. Restart auto-ssh

Disable the autossh daemon:

```bash
$ svcadm disable autossh-dispatcher
```

Check if there is a rogue ssh process hanging on:

```bash
$ ps aux | grep ssh
```

If there is one left, `kill -9` it:

```bash
$ kill -9 <pid>
```

Enable auto-ssh:

```bash
$ svcam enable autossh-dispatcher
```

### 6.3. Test auto-ssh

From your dev machine, start a fake dispatcher process listening to port 9181:

```bash
$ nc -l -p 9181
```

From the runner VM type:

```bash
$ nc localhost 9181
```

Now, type into the console, hitting <enter>. Everything you type should appear on the nc output in your dev machine.

Do the reverse, typing on your dev machine. Everything you enter should appear on your runner nc process output.


### 6.4. Customize runner VM metadata

From the __global__ zone, edit the file `/zone/<runner vm uuid>/config/metadata.json`. In the `customer_metadata` object, add a property named `parent` containing the global zone IP address.

Test it by logging into the runner VM and issuing:

```bash
$ mdata-get parent
```

It should output the global zone IP address.


### 6.5. Configure the runner SSH key in the global zone

The runner needs to ssh into the global zone to talk to indirectly other worker VMs. For the runner to be able to ssh into the global zone you need to add the runner ssh key to it.

From __within the runner__, echo the runner public key:

```bash
$ echo ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Copy it into the clipboard.

Now, on the __global zone__, create the `/usbkey/config.inc` directory if it does not exist yet:

```bash
$ mkdir -p /usbkey/config.inc
```

Now, edit a file named `/usbkey/config.inc/authorized_keys` and paste the runner public key to it. Save and exit.

Now, run this command:

```bash
$ echo "root_authorized_keys_file=authorized_keys" >>/usbkey/config
```

Restart the entire SmartOS VM.


### 6.6. Test that you can ssh from the runner into the global zone

SSH into it.

zlogin into the runner VM.

Try to ssh from the runner into the global zone:

```bash
$ ssh `mdata-get parent`
```

### 6.7. Enable the runner service:

```bash
$ svcadm enable ntrace-runner
```


## 7. Create a worker VM

### 7.1. Import the generic image

From the global zone, list all the ntrace images:

```bash
$ imgadm avail | grep ntrace
```

Copy the UUID for the latest `ntrace-smartos-base` image.

Import it:

```bash
$ imgadm import <image uuid>
```

### 7.2. Create the Worker VM

Copy the manifest from [here](https://github.com/ntrace/provisioner/blob/master/templates/default.json) into a file named `manifest.json` and set the `image_uuid` field to the image uuid you just imported.

Create a worker VM by:

```bash
$ vmadm create < manifest.json
```

### 7.3. Create a worker VM snapshot

Now, create a snapshot of the recently created worked VM. This snapshot will be named `clean` and it will serve as the state the worker will rollback to before each run.

```bash
$ vmadm create-snapshot <worker vm uuid> clean
```

### 7.4. Alias the worker VM

To distinguish your worker VM, alias it to `runner-1` using:

```bash
$ vmadm update <worker vm uuid> alias=runner-1
```

(this step is not strictly necessary, but it may be useful to distinguish vms when listing them).

## 8. Enroll the new worker

From the __runner VM__, open a connectionto the runner service:

```bash
$ nc localhost 9182
```

Type the following JSON, followed by <ENTER>:

```javascript
["enroll", ["<worker vm uuid>"], 1]
```

That should be it. Any issue / discrepancy please talk to me.

Cheers!

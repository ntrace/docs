# Dispatcher Setup

Clone the dispatchers source to your local development machine. Not on SmartOS.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ntrace/dispatcher.git
$ cd dispatcher
$ npm i
$ # npm start; echo 'npm tries to run server.js, so try node index.js'
$ node index.js

```

The runner on the SmartOS VM then connects to the dispatcher using the ssh tunnel
we had setup in the previous chapter. This will listen to commands on port `9181`.


With that up and started we can try sending a task to run.

First lets emulate a payload that will represent what the github hooks will be:

```
$ cat > payload.json
["push",[{"before":"f672b3e17487eaa8399c67a9f0e3d1b052995f32","after":"1db18cb487e86691d2099151d715bcb5dd48ccc7","ref":"refs/heads/master","commits":[{"id":"f672b3e17487eaa8399c67a9f0e3d1b052995f32","message":"making runs asynchronous","timestamp":"2013-02-22T13:50:07-08:00","url":"https://github.com/pgte/benchmark-tests/commit/1db18cb487e86691d2099151d715bcb5dd48ccc7","added":[],"removed":[],"modified":["run.js"],"author":{"name":"Pedro Teixeira","email":"pedro.teixeira@gmail.com"}}],"repository":{"name":"benchmark-tests","url":"https://github.com/pgte/benchmark-tests","description":"Testing 123","homepage":"","watchers":1,"forks":0,"private":false,"owner":{"name":"pgte","email":"pedro.teixeira@gmail.com"}}}],1]
```

Now to send this to our dispatcher.

```

$ cat payload > localhost 9181

```

Enter the runner vm and check the logs, hopefully it should be apparent of what the issue is.
